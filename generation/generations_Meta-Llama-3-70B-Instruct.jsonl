As a parent, I'm always on the lookout for high-quality baby wipes that are gentle on my little one's skin, and these wipes have exceeded my expectations.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was the generous quantity - 120 wipes per pack, with 20 packs in total. This is amazing value for the price, and I love that I don't have to worry about running out anytime soon.\n\nBut what really impressed me was the quality of the wipes themselves. They're incredibly soft and gentle, making them perfect for my baby's sensitive skin. The \"pure light\" formula is fragrance-free and hypoallergenic, which gives me peace of mind knowing that I'm not exposing my child to any harsh chemicals.\n\nThe wipes are also very effective at cleaning up messes, whether it's a diaper blowout or a spill during mealtime. They're sturdy and durable, and I've never had to use more than one wipe to get the job done.\n\nOverall, I'm so happy with this purchase and would highly recommend the 코멧 퓨어 라이트 아기물티슈 to any parent looking for a reliable and gentle baby wipe. Five stars isn't enough - I'd give it ten stars if I could!", "input": "", "id": "3", "model_name": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct"}

For each event, we consider two cases:\n\n1. If the `k`-th student is not included in the subset (i.e., `(i & (1 << k)) == 0`), we can include them in the subset and add their ability to the sum.\n2. If the `k`-th student is already included in the subset, we cannot include them again.\n\nWe update `dp[i][j]` with the maximum sum of abilities considering the current subset and event.\n\nFinally, we return the maximum sum of abilities for all events, which is stored in `dp[-1]`.\n\nNote that the time complexity of this solution is O(2^n \\* m), which is acceptable since `n` is at most 10.", "input": "", "id": "32", "model_name": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct"}

Never go to bed angry, and always find time to laugh together. As you build your life together, I hope you will continue to grow, to learn, and to explore the world together.

Always prioritize each other, and never let the world come between you. Be each other's rock, each other's safe haven. Don't be afraid to show your love and affection, and don't be afraid to apologize when you're wrong. Remember that marriage is a partnership, not a competition. And always, always remember that I love you, no matter what. You are my daughter, and I will always be here for you, to support you, to guide you, and to love you.\n\n**Paragraph 4: Message for my son-in-law**\n\nAnd to my new son-in-law, I want to welcome you into our family with open arms.

{"output": "What a fascinating problem! 🌱️ Let's create a 8x8 grid that satisfies the conditions.

I started by placing one of each type of vegetable (A, B, C, D, E) in the first row, making sure that no two adjacent cells have the same vegetable.\n2. For each subsequent row, I rotated the previous row by one position to the right. This ensures that each cell has a different vegetable than the one above it.\n3. I repeated step 2 for each row, making sure to maintain the condition that no two adjacent cells have the same vegetable.\n\nThis solution satisfies the conditions:\n\n* Each cell has only one type of vegetable.\n* No two adjacent cells (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) have the same vegetable.\n\nNote that there may be other possible solutions, but this one should work! 😊", "input": "", "id": "59", "model_name": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct"}
